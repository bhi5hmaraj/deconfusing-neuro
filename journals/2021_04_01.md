	Summary:
		**fMRI intro**
			non-invasive
			based on BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) signal
				signal changes due to:
					hemodynamics
					metabolic sequelae #unsure
			localized functions can be identified
				because of spatial segregation in the brain
			high spatial resolution
		**mechanism**
			causal nesting
				Hemoglobin two types: 
					deoxy vs oxy
						deoxy is paramagnetic
							(because of high spin state of heme iron) 
						oxy is diamagnetic
							oxy-bound has low spin
					magnetic susceptibility of area is different because of these two
						these differences cause MRI magnetic field to induce distortions
							(distortions in blood and surrounding area)
							water protons sense distortions
								reflected in signal decay process
									signal decay process characterized by relaxation of:
										$$T_2$$  (spin echo)
										$$T_2^*$$ (gradient echo)
								relaxation of these protons changes on deoxygenation
									this change is detectable in MRI machine
										seen as image intensity differences called **BOLD**
			inference nesting #unfinished
				detect difference in brain activity
					see (BOLD) image on MRI monitor
						has different intensities for different activities
							different intensities come from differences in "water proton" relaxation
								relaxation
			
		**neural basis**
			
				BOLD changes are associated with __inputs__, not outputs
					...which means we can make inferences only about assmblies, not individual neurons
				neural activity-BOLD signal coupling is very tight
					allows probing via fMRI
						even though response time of BOLD is __several seconds__ and slower than the underlying neuronal processes
					**coupling details**
						metabolic load change is coupled to neuronal activation
						vascular response is also coupled tightly
							the mechanism here involves glutamate
								which is released for synaptic activation
								which induces a change in Ca$$^{+2}$$ in neighboring astrocytes
							leads to increase in CBF
								(via release of blood vessel dilators)
					
		**positive and negative BOLD changes**
			justifcation for using BOLD signal changes
				correspondence between BOLD delta and excitatory action
					positive BOLD changes correlate with field potential increase
				positive BOLD means local neuronal activities
					corresponds to $$\Delta Y > 0$$, or hyper-oxygenation
			caveats:
				areas that show negative BOLD
					but relatively small
					explanations:
						suppression of local synaptic activity relative to a control state
							...so CBF and CMRO$$_2$$ decrease, and lead to $$\Delta Y < -0$$
						some areas show negative BOLD to stimuli
							like BA 31/7, in parietal area
					neurobio mechanisms not well understood
						...but thankfully no definitive case of inhibition causing positive BOLD
							although active inhibition requires synaptic activity
				possible for BOLD signal to change without local neural activity
					likely to 
						be diffuse, 
						expressed in large areas,
						not well synched with neuronal events.
					because of physiological variations in cerebral circulatoin
		**Advantages and Disadvantages of BOLD**
			category-specific adv and disadv
				Two types of signals
					echo gradient
						advantages
							high sensitivity
							simplicity of measurement
						disadvantages
							limited spatial resolution
							signal contamination
								with large surface vessels
								can be large value (10-20 percent)
									especially when nearby activated areas send their more oxygenated venous blood to a draining surface vessel
					CBV
						advantages
							better spatial resolution
								can see this in cat brains
									visual area can be resolved by CBV but not EG
										throught cortical structures
				Another categorization of signals (based on capillary region)
					intra-vascular
						sensed at low magnetic field
							1.5T MRI
							BOLD effect is present, independent of size of vessel
								both for spin echo and gradient echo
					extra-vascular
						sensed at super-high field MRI
							> 7T
							BOLD effect present for spin echo
						advantageous
							better functuonal specificity
							higher spatial resolution
			general adv and disadv
				(for all measurements based on vascular changes)
				disadvantages
					slow response time
						(ie seconds)
						slow events are fine
						fast events make it difficult to disentangle overlap in signal
							and neural dynamics proceed at 10 - 100 ms
						measuring the latency
							can be done with other instruments
								 MEG or EEG
							can also use BOLD
								temporal relation may be probed
									when:
										between funcitonal systems
										when there is inter-system interaction
									how:
										look for event related signal changes
											with a well-defined paradigm
											which contains a few inputs
											can be deconvolved from BOLD time-series
		**Non-BOLD measurements**
			Non-invasive measurements
				CBF and CBV
					both based on vascular response
						have better specificity for localizing functional activity
							in capillaries
							or linked to blood volume change
					both have shorter response time
						by about a second
							which corresponds to transit time 
								from arterial side to venous side of the capillary bed
				MRI (in a different way)
					(with an application of strong field gradients)
						as in water diffusion measurement
					responds to neuronal activation
						reflects a change in the apparent diffusion constant of water in the tissue
					has good spatial specificity
					possible mechanism:
						cellular swelling caused by neural activity
					more study is needed to establish mechanism and characteristics
				MRI __direct__ (speculative)
					ambitions of detecting electromagnetic events caused by neural activity directly
					would provide high spatial and temporal resolution
					despite experiments __in vitro__, detection __in vivo__ still eludes spectroscopists
		**(low) frequency signals and spontaneous activity**
			MRI time seies data can be analyzed in terms of frequency distribution
				power is largely in the low frequency region
					(far below respiration rate)
				some peaks at 0.1Hz (or lower)
					0.1 Hz used to be attributed to "vaso-motion" #unsure 
						as in __in vivo__ optical measurements
					vascular modulation can lead to CBF variations
						if so, modulation is is not likely due to the local neuronal activity
							but some signal to the vascular system from remote areas
				low freqency oscillations shown to represent neuroactivity
					ie. "correlations between low freqency oscillations at resting state" marked presence of "connectivity between functionally related sites"
					also, there is slow modulation of power of neural oscillation
						may reflect long range coordination in a functional network
						(oscillation in gamma range)
						(recent report)
				spontaneous fluctuation
					were explored to find functional networks
					simultaenous measurements have provided correlates
						EEG + fMRI provided electrophysiological correlates
				caveat
					slow fMRI oscillation superimposes on activation without interaction
					more to learn on physiological basis of slow oscillation
		**Activation maps and functional networks** #unfinished 
			'BOLD activity'-to-'mental process' maps
				examples:
					visual recognition
						of objects with what/where information
					language and music perception
					Cognitive processes (Emotions, feelings)
					Humanities and Social Sciences (morality, economic decision making)
						human moral judgement (Greene and Haidt 2002)
				To understand how the brain works we need to know the functional network of sites participating in a functional task
					 constellation of observed sites constitutes a major part of these networks
						question there is how and in which order the sites in the network interact each other to transfer information
							need new ways to answer this question even with multimodal imaging with fMRI and EEG
					Some of high-order cognitive tasks generate neuronal oscillations
						Simultaneous recording of fMRI and EEG data can show the presence of the functional network integrated by neural oscillations
					
				also necessary to know the functional specificity of each activated site 
					(to understand distributed networks in the brain)
					the functional role or specificity of a site is only established indirectly
						 Many of functional sites are activated with multiple functional inputs
							although these inputs may have common features
						Without the knowledge of the functional specificity and local functional architecture, the working of the network can only be understood in anecdotal terms
							because we cannot measure the actual input to or output from a site
							only means we have for controlling the site’s activation is through the external or internal stimulus we give to the brain.
								It is not known which aspects of the original stimulus are delivered to the site or how site-specific processing proceeds
							Until we understand the information processing entailed by the local input-output relationships, we can only try to infer this processing by clever manipulations of the stimuli we give to the brain
			Success of fMRI due to statistical data processing (Friston et al.)
				Why needed ?
					Raw fMRI has low signal to noise ratio (due to fluctuations within and among the participants)
				How it helped
					 roles of activated sites are often examined by some comparison
						comparison of carefully chosen paradigms that are nearly identical but with targeted distinction
						 many low-level activation sites as well as common functional sites are eliminated by the criteria of statistically significant differences in evoked responses

	Questions
		Why does depolarization go in one direction?
			[Action Potential in the Neuron - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6rvUJlg7o)
		Is there any use of decussations (cross over of nerves) or is it just a random thing
		Is the motor-sensory distinction "articifial" or "natural"?
			if Friston is right, and action is inference, then maybe they ought not to be so cleanly separated?
			but then why are the motor and sensory areas so cleanly divided physically?
				are they, or is it again an artefact of neuroepistemology?
				also Conway's law relevant?
					seems like the converse (abstract organization -> physical organization rather than the other way around)
	Summary
		**2. The Brain**
			1. INTRODUCTION
				human brain has 100 billion neurons
					each neuron connected to 10,000 other neurons
				the brain is far from a unitary structure, 
					although we do label it as such: the brain
					full of levels of conflicting thought and emotion, and internal dilemmas
				Formed of two major hemispheres, each with four cortical lobes, along with midbrain, brainstem, and cerebellum
				A central issue in understanding the brain is determining our level of analysis
					disciplines of 
						neuroanatomy
							describe the key major structures of the brain
							eg. cortex, subcortical regions, cerbellum, brainstem
						neurophysiology
							electrochemical processes inside and across neurons
							eg. neuron internals, action potential, broadmann areas
						functional neuroanatomy
							how the many brain areas contribute to our functional selves
							eg. frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, medial-termporal lobe, occipital lobe
						neuroconnectivity
							how information travels throughout the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord
							eg. corpus callosum, arcuate fasciuclus, internal capsule
						neurodynamics
							the “traffic” on those streets as we explore the brain’s dynamic processe
							eg. brain rhythms and oscillations
			2. BRAIN STRUCTURE NEUROANATOMY
				brain is situated around...
					the top of the CNS
					under the skull
					connected to the body via brainstem + spinal cord

								medial
									towards the middle
								lateral
									towards the sides
								anterior
									front
								posterior

					cortical anatomy
						Latin(Cortex) = Bark
							indeed the cortex has a look of the bark of a tree with all of its fine ridges and grooves
						gross structure
							Made up of grey matter 
								the cell bodies of the billions of nerve cells (neurons)
							ridges and valleys
								small grooves of the cortex are called **sulci**
									a tiny valley that contains more of the grey matter that is visible on the surface of the cortex
									three giant sulci
										the Sylvian fissure 
											(sometimes referred to as the Lateral Fissure) 
											extending from the frontal lobe back between the parietal and temporal lobes;
										the central sulcus
											separates the frontal and parietal lobes
										longitudinal fissure 
											runs between the two hemispheres.
								ridges are called **gyri**
									each gyrus is a small bump on the surface of the cortex
						parts
							two cerebral hemispheres
								connectivity bridge called the **corpus callosum** between them
								very light in color
									because it is made up of white matter
										formed by the myelinated axons that extend from neurons
										myelin sheath around the axon is made up of a white fatlike substance 
											serves to increase the signal transmission along the axon.
							four cortical lobes
								frontal
								parietal
								temporal
								occipitaI
				Subcortex:
					beneath the cortex
					contains many bodies or nuclei that perform important functions ranging from control of movement to emotional processing
					thalamus
						deep in the center of the brain
						highly interconnected with all parts of the cortex
						both together called **thalamocortical system**
						thalamic connections with the four lobes of the cortex are highly structured
							with complex connective patterns between the thalamus and each cortical lobe 
							as well as many other subcortical bodies and regions
					basal ganglia
						group of subcortical nuclei or bodies
						#function
							primarily engaged in influencing motor (movement) control 
								along with the motor cortex
									and the spinal cord
								damage to the basal ganglia leads to motor dysfunction 
									despite an intact motor cortex and spinal cord
						nuclei of the basal ganglia are located...
							posterior to the frontal lobe 
							include nuclei:
								(which play key roles in motor as well as emotional and cognitive functions) #function 
								the putamen
								the caudate nucleus
								the globus pallidus
								the nucleus accumbens
